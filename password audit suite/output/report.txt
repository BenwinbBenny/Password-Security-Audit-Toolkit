PASSWORD SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
====================================
Date: 2026-02-10

HASH IDENTIFICATION RESULTS
----------------------------
MD5, SHA-512 (Linux Shadow), and NTLM-style hashes were identified.
MD5 and NTLM are considered weak and vulnerable to modern attacks.

PASSWORD STRENGTH ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Multiple weak and reused passwords were detected.
Common patterns and dictionary-based passwords were present.

BRUTE-FORCE SIMULATION RESULTS
-------------------------------
Short passwords (<8 characters) are highly vulnerable.
Longer passwords significantly increase cracking time.

SECURITY RISKS
---------------
- Weak password complexity
- Predictable patterns
- Outdated hashing algorithms

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Enforce minimum 12–16 character passwords
- Require mixed character sets
- Implement account lockout policies
- Use modern hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Conduct periodic password audits

FINAL VERDICT
--------------
Overall password posture: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
